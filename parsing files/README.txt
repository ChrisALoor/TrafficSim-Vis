  *   This code was developed to process data from MATSim outputs. And its  *
  *   main purpose is to achieve the visualization of the simulations       *
  *   through a single-page application.                                    *

      To process the MATSim files 'output_network.xml.gz' and 'output.events.xmlgz'
      you can choose to reproduce it in notebook format or as a single script, the 
      steps to execute are found within each of them.
